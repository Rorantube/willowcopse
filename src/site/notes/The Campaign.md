**Opening Monologue**
*You have a task: find the lost, and hunt the un-huntable. The Hunter's Guild in the nearby town has put out a bounty.* **(show/pass around included handout [[BOUNTY Handout.png]])** *Earlier, in the local tavern - The Drowned Cup*

**Interaction**
Characters present

**Bartender -**
There's a good chance your players will go to the bartender for information regarding the guild, this is where they will get that information.

***Nathaniel Bernal***
A portly, older, possibly in his late 60's, gentleman. He has scars on his forearms, and is about 6'4" (1.9 m). He's tired, but always has a warm smile.

He's loved by the community, and has gathered quite the reputation of being a kind man, whom the frequenter's of The Drowned Cup would defend, if the need arose.


**Patrons -**
If your players interact with any patrons, these are some options.

Drunk Patron 1
A messy, disheveled man, wearing a faded brown coat. He's drinking out of a large glass mug, waiting for his buddies to show up. He's known to be a big gambler, and unable to turn down pretty people.

Drunk Patron 2
A semi-put together woman, wearing a blouse and a vest. She's wandering around, drunkenly flirting with *everyone*. She's known around here for that.

Old Man
An older man, sitting in the corner, watching the rain from the window. He has a glass of whisky, and if asked what he's doing, he says that he is waiting for his wife (she's fine, just late tonight).


The bartender will tell the players that he is a retired member of the Hunter's Guild, and points them to the direction of the *Lonely Lady*, a small magic and commodity shop not too far away.

****
*As you walk the streets, its getting darker by the minute and the rain is picking up. You have got to get out of this rain.*

Have players roll a perception check. Those who roll above a 18 see a cloaked man watching them from the window of a closed shop.

*Its near pitch black when you see a light outside of a closed shop. You're drenched and cold. The winter months are really not really good ones to get caught in the freezing rain.
As you approach the lamp, you see the words carved on a metal sheet above the door: Lonely Lady. You have made it.

Give players the option to roll an investigation check, applicable to:

The Door
- Old wooden door, (DC14) a mark at the foot of the door, bearing the symbol of the Hunter's Guild
The Lamp
- (DC16) Embossed on the glass of the lamp is the faint sigil of the Hunter's guild
The Sign
- Made of some kind of black or painted, hammered metal

****
*You go to open the door and it is locked shut, of course. You hear a voice from behind you, making you all jump. He says:* "Halt, what business do you have with a closed store?"

The party may have a conversation with the hooded figure. He is a member of the Hunter's Guild, and has a key, but must be convinced to let the party in. Persuasion DC10.

If/when successful,
*The hooded man lowers his hood and inserts the key into to door, and opens it. He leads you through a maze of shelves stacked high with magic items, potions, and books.*

If a player attempts to steal something,
*The hooded man turns to you and says,* "I... wouldn't steal from Matilda. She's got, uh... 'magic tripwires' all over the place. I tried to steal something once, when I was new here. Phew, Hell hath no fury, I can tell you that much." *He chuckles and turns back around, leading you through the store.*

*Eventually, you make it to the back of the shop, where a space opens up. About 30ft across, and 40ft deep, with ceilings no more that 15ft high. A large hearth is lit on the far side of the room, illuminating the space, which's walls were stacked high with books, and mounted heads from creatures hunted. The floor was covered in large, colorful and comfortable looking bags, filled with some form of fluffy substance. There are a few people here, waiting.

*The man leading you here steps in and hangs his cloak up on a coat rack.* "Sorry I'm late, friends. I was keeping an eye on these ones," *he gestures to you* "And lost track of time. Lets get started, shall we?"

**Character's present**

**Guildmaster**
This is the head of the guild. He escorted the party through the store.

Chris Havenstride
Current guild master of the Hunter's Guild. He is well respected by his peers, and has the highest successful hunt count (268 Hunts, though he would argue 269), second only to the previous guild master (307).

**The other hunters**

**Lo Stoutfal**
A dwarven hunter. He has the most seniority in the guild (82 years), and is often a mentor to new members of the guild.

**Norx* Hillarow**
An elven hunter. She has the second most seniority in the guild (81 years), and is at odds with Lo in a (mostly) friendly competition.

\*pronounced Nor

*The hunters present all nod and pull out small notebooks.* "But first," the guildmaster turns to your party, "Lets introduce ourselves and get acquainted. My name is Chris Havenstride. The dwarf tending the fire is Lo, the elf giving him dirty looks in Norx, **COME BACK TO THIS**. May we have your names?"

Allow the party to introduce themselves to the gathered hunters. Ask your players if they would like to introduce the reason they're here (the bounty).

If your players introduce the bounty
*The members blink in suprise.* 
(Lo) "Wow, l'right. 'Aven't had someone ballsy enough t' try and take that in a *while*, eh, pointy?"
(Norx) "No, no one in at least a year. An- Hey! Don't call me pointy! That-" *The squabble continues in the background*
