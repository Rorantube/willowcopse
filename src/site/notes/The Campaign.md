**Opening Monologue**
*You have a task: find the lost, and hunt the un-huntable. The Hunter's Guild in the nearby town has put out a bounty.* **(show/pass around included handout [[BOUNTY Handout.png]])** ![BOUNTY Handout.png](/img/user/Handouts/BOUNTY%20Handout.png)*Earlier, in the local tavern - The Drowned Cup*

**Interaction**
Characters present

**Bartender -**
There's a good chance your players will go to the bartender for information regarding the guild, this is where they will get that information.

***Nathaniel Bernal***
A portly, older, possibly in his late 60's, gentleman. He has scars on his forearms, and is about 6'4" (1.9 m). He's tired, but always has a warm smile.

He's loved by the community, and has gathered quite the reputation of being a kind man, whom the frequenter's of The Drowned Cup would defend.


**Patrons -**
If your players interact with any patrons, these are some options.

Drunk Patron 1
A messy, disheveled man, wearing a faded brown coat. He's drinking out of a large glass mug, waiting for his buddies to show up. He's known to be a big gambler, and unable to turn down pretty people.

Drunk Patron 2
A semi-put together woman, wearing a blouse and a vest. She's wandering around, drunkenly flirting with *everyone*. She's known around here for that.

Old Man
An older man, sitting in the corner, watching the rain from the window. He has a glass of whisky, and if asked what he's doing, he says that he is waiting for his wife (she's fine, just late tonight).


The bartender will tell the players that he is a retired member of the Hunter's Guild, and points them to the direction of the *Lonely Lady*, a small magic and commodity shop not too far away.

****
*As you walk the streets, its getting darker by the minute and the rain is picking up. You have got to get out of this rain.*

Have players roll a perception check. Those who roll above a 18 see a cloaked man watching them from the window of a closed shop.

*Its near pitch black when you see a light outside of a closed shop. You're drenched and cold. The winter months are really not really good ones to get caught in the freezing rain.
As you approach the lamp, you see the words carved on a metal sheet above the door: Lonely Lady. You have made it.

Give players the option to roll an investigation check, applicable to:

The Door
- Old wooden door, (DC14) a mark at the foot of the door, bearing the symbol of the Hunter's Guild
The Lamp
- (DC16) Embossed on the glass of the lamp is the faint sigil of the Hunter's guild
The Sign
- Made of some kind of black or painted, hammered metal
